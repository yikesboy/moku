# About Moku

Moku is my personal static site generator born out of a desire to simplify my web development workflow. Inspired by "mokuhanga" (木版画, a traditional Japanese woodblock printing technique), this tool reflects my minimalist preference when it comes to creating and consuming websites and their content.

## How does it work?
- build a single, reusable template and CSS design
- add content through markdown files
- Moku automatically generates and renders the website with zero fuss

## Disclaimer
This is very much a personal project. Moku is *feature-incomplete* and evolves purely based on what I need right now. It's a living tool that grows alongside my own web publishing requirements - no more, no less.

The beauty of Moku lies in its raw simplicity: it's *my* solution to *my* web publishing challenges, crafted exactly the way I want it.

Feel free to adapt Moku to your own needs though.
